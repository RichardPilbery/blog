This website does not track your interaction or activity. The embedded Tweets have been set to not track you, but if you click on them and visit Twitter's website, all bets are off. I've also set the privacy enhanced mode on YouTube, but I think this does not work once you click on the video.

The only cookies are those from font-awesome and openstreetmap. You can disable both if you wish.
