## Lessons learned from MAJAX

At times a really emotive session this one, particularly the talk delivered by David Waters from SJA NZ talking about the Christchurch shootings. Clearly still very raw.

+ Christchurch - whole incident took <1 hours
+ Initial investigative report due in July

Things to do (courtesy of Stefan Poloczek): 

1. Prepare for next MAJAX
2. Physical and psychological cleaning after current incident required
3. Debrief responders
4. Emphasise current feelings/emotions normal reaction to non-normal event
5. Care about the commanders (they made the decisions)
6. Prevent rumours (talk about what happened)
7. Take part in memorial ceremonies
8. Prepare for press and politician communication
9. Inform colleagues and other professionals
10. Prepare for the question - ‘Do you need more money?’
11. What’s next (check for next targetable event(s))
12. Beware of the anniverary

This was promptly followed by a major incident exercise in the conference venue! It was meant to take place in a nearby military airfield, but the Minister of defence cancelled it! It was quite good fun really.
