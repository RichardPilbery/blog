title: EMS2019 Madrid Conference

I recently was lucky enough to go to the EMS2019 Madrid conference in Spain. [SATIATED](https://satiated.netlify.com) was shortlisted for an oral abstract. Made it into the top 10 and got some glass. Nice.

However, there were some really interesting talks and discussions at the conference and I thought it helpful to jot a few down here.

## Stroke

Lots on stroke at this conference. It kicked off early with one of the initial presentations announcing the upcoming Utstein guidelines on stroke care.

Interesting stats:

+ 1% of EMS calls are for stroke
+ >50% wait before calling for help

The guidelines focus on 5 themes:

1. Stroke registry
2. Early recognition
	+ Public
		+ Implement novel stroke awareness campaigns
		+ Educated public about needing utilise ambulance service
		+ Educate the younger generation, not just (older) at-risk population
	+ Medical
		+ Improve EMS education for op staff and dispatchers
		+ Encourage use of FAST
		+ Focus on in-hospital stroke education (?for patients) during initial stroke admission to identify stroke risk factors and importance of FAST/calling ambulance
		+Appoint stroke educators
		+ Remove need for family member consent before thrombolysis
3. Structural
	+ Develop stroke centre capability maps to assist EMS
	+ Develop telemedicine networks, particularly in remote areas
	+ Develop support systems to enable patients and families to afford the cost of drugs and other treatment after discharge
4. Prehospital care
5. Emergency Care

10 programmes to increase survival: 

1. Establish a stroke registry
2. Create public awareness
3. Start public education
4. Improve early recognition
5. Practice rapid and timely dispatch
6. Optimise prehospital stroke care and triage
7. Optimise in-hospital basic and advanced care
8. User smart technologies
9. Demonstrate accountability
10. Create a culture of excellence


### In-Hospital Basic and Advanced Care

+ Pre-notification of incoming stroke by paramedics
+ Activating stroke team
+ Rapid patient registration
+ Moving patient direct to CT scanner by EMS
+ Not waiting for lab results, unless indicated (e.g. INR)
+ Administering alteplase (tPA) in the CT scanner of telestroke bay

## Stroke sessions

Really interesting talk from Tony Rudd, a Stroke Consultant at St Thomas’ Hospital and the National Clinical Director for Stroke with NHS England and the London Stroke Clinical Director.

### Context

+ Burden of stroke in Europe  - 45% increase in stroke deaths and 32% more DALYs in next 20 years + (2015-2035)
+ Revascularisation only benefits 5% of stroke patients
+ 10% patients die
+ 30% spontaneously recover with good basic care

{{< figure src="./images/thrombectomy-in-context.jpg" caption="Thrombolysis and thrombectomy in context - most patients won't benefit from revascularisation so good stroke care and rehab is essential">}}

### Major barriers

+	Poor public knowledge/recognition
+	Inefficient processes pre-hospital/front-door
+	Thrombectomy services not yet established

### Recognition

+	FAST best of a bad lot
    + 100 screened
    + 62 have stroke/TIA
    + 7 missed

### Response

+	Praised Copenhagen for 21 minute median on-scene time (IQR 16-27 mins)

+ Just about to start project in England - data linkage to include total patient journey time (to justify specialist centres which may lead to increase ambulance journey times). {{< figure src="./images/audit.jpg">}}
+ Not that enthusiastic about stroke ambulances. Felt it was better to have more efficient front door hospital services.

### Sentinal stroke national audit data 2017-18:

+ Shortening door to needle time important
  + Pre-alerts
  + Stroke team waiting etc.

### Lengthening windows for some type of strokes:
Endovascular thrombectomy for ischemic stroke 6 to 16 hours (up to 24 hours in Nogueira study)  after a patient was last known to be well plus standard medical therapy resulted in better functional outcomes than standard medical therapy alone among patients with proximal middle-cerebral-artery or internal-carotid-artery occlusion and a region of tissue that was ischemic but not yet infarcted.
