## Enganging 1st responders using an app in Paris

This presentation was given by Lionel Lamhaut. He stated that the mean response time in France is 14 mins. Recent change in French law means that citizens are no longer liable for adverse events that occur secondary to administering care to others.

Developed [Citizen rescuer app](https://sauvlife.fr/), similar to [GoodSAM](https://www.goodsamapp.org/) and has video conferencing too! Highlighted importance of contacting responders to check they are okay (Zijlstra, J. A., Beesems, S. G., De Haan, R. J., & Koster, R. W. (2015). Psychological impact on dispatched local lay rescuers performing bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Resuscitation, 92, 115â€“121. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resuscitation.2015.04.028)

Interestingly, they send 'citizens' into people's private residences too, which I don't think GoodSAM do. 

## Dispatch of volunteer citizen responders by smartphone apps

Linn Andelius discussed another smartphone app in Copenhagen. Members of the public are activated bia app. AED location and times of availability are known so responders only sent to AEDs that are available.

Media coverage leads to surge of sign-ups. Following a news piece, 1,000 additional sign-ups. Currently 48,103 registered with 98% trained in CPR.

When cardiac arrest comes in within 1,800m of phone, 5 sent. 1 person sent to do CPR, 4 are sent for an AED.

Debriefing is provided (recognised that managing psychological distress important) and responders are not sent to: 

+ TCA
+ <8 years
+ When no AED is required
+ Caller is not with patient.


## The international experience with GoodSam as a first responder app and future perspectives

Mark Wilson spoke about GoodSam. Showed pulse assessment by pointing camera at face of patient.
