### Abstract

Background: The mobile health-/social care unit (MHSCU) is a specialized unit within the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in the Capital Region of Denmark. It provides acute social care for social deprived citizens and is staffed with a social worker and a paramedic. This study was to evaluate the MHSCU-dispatch outcomes and the combination of paramedical and social effort.

Method Data on the total number of MHSCU dispatches and outcomes in 2016 and 2017 was retrieved from the dispatch system operated by EMS Copenhagen and descriptively analyzed.

Results MHSCU was dispatched 2976 times. Of these 384 patients (12.9%) were brought to a somatic emergency department (ED) and 255 (8.6%) to a psychiatric ED. A total of 355 patients (11.9%) were left to selfcare while 196 (6.6%) were brought to a shelter. Referred from EMS was 41 (1.4%) and referred to EMS was 4 (0.1%). referred to police was 13 (0.4%). In 1386 (46.6%) cases MHSCU were doing proactive work, citizen had left scene or MHSCU was cancelled. The remaining 342 (11.5%) were ‘unknown’.

Conclusion Based on the low referral to emergency ambulances and police, the dispatch of MHSCU seems well-prioritized. Dispatches-outcome also indicate the need for both paramedical and social staffing as there is an approximately even distribution between health related and social related referral. This study concludes that a MHSCU can serve as a valuable resource in EMS systems.
