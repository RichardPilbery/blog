## Enganging 1st responders using an app in Paris

This presentation was given by Lionel Lamhaut. He stated that the mean response time in France is 14 mins. Recent change in French law means that citizens are no longer liable for adverse events that occur secondary to administering care to others.

Developed [Citizen rescuer app](https://sauvlife.fr/), similar to [GoodSAM](https://www.goodsamapp.org/) and has video conferencing too! Highlighted importance of contacting responders to check they are okay (Zijlstra, J. A., Beesems, S. G., De Haan, R. J., & Koster, R. W. (2015). Psychological impact on dispatched local lay rescuers performing bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Resuscitation, 92, 115â€“121. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resuscitation.2015.04.028)

Interestingly, they send 'citizens' into people's private residences too, which I don't think GoodSAM do.
